# OrganellarMetagenomics

A bioinformatics pipeline for recovering complete organellar genomes from metagenomic data. Scripts for:

- Data download from NCBI SRA using SRA-Toolkit
- Quality trimming with Trimmomatic
- De novo assembly with GetOrganelle
- Quality assessment through mapping with SMALT and SAMtools
- Variant calling with BCFtools

Enables extraction of high-quality organellar genomes from environmental DNA, revealing hidden eukaryotic diversity.
